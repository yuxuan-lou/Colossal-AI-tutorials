# Colossal-AI Step by Step Tutorial


## From data parallel to hybrid parallel: Accelerate ViT training with Colossal-AI
[Code](https://github.com/yuxuan-lou/Step-by-Step-ViT-training-on-Cifar10-with-Colossal-AI)

Colossal-AI provides three different parallelism techniques which acclerate model training: data parallelism, pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism. 
In this example, we will show you how to train ViT on Cifar10 dataset with these parallelism techniques. To run this example, you will need 2-4 gpus.
